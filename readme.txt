Track time and monitor user activity & history on your website, LMS online learning system, membership or WooCommerce site.

== Description ==

**Track user activity & duration on your website with this incredibly powerful, easy-to-use and well supported plugin.**

This plugin is privacy-friendly: it stores no cookies on users' computers and therefore requires no cookie opt-in from users (unlike Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager).

The plugin is especially useful for tracking users on membership sites, **LMS online learning systems** or **WooCommerce** sites. It can track both **logged-in** and **anonymous users**.

You can track **page visits**, **duration of the visit**, **login and logout time**, and you can even setup **event goal triggers** too (ie. click of a button, PDF download, mailto links and more).

Our plugin will accurately track time spent on specific pages which is very useful when you'd like to monitor user's reading time, video watching time, tracking time in LMS online learning system, or how long users look at your e-commerce product pages before purchasing.

### Testimonials

★★★★★
> “Tried many, but this one had just what I wanted. I like this plugins feature set, minimal but exactly what I need to see. Helps me to send offers on a WooCommerce digital content site when I notice users are looking at a particular product often, but not purchasing. A little nudge helps and this plugin puts that info in a place I can easily see.” - [Ryan](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/tried-many-but-this-one-had-just-what-i-wanted/)
